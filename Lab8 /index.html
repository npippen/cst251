    <h1> Challenges</h1>
    <p1> <span class="maintext"> This lab was mainly foccused on more of the customization of a webpage. We added color,
    borders and spacing to the webpage along with the usual image. It was a challenege because we needed to use a css file to
    create this stylisation and in general its not very easy. I have trouble with making sure I'm not missing any information
     or code.   </span></p1>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2> Problems</h2>
    <p2> <span class="maintext"> The main problem I had was getting the css file I made to commit to my html. I kept on changing many things
    that I noticed might have been causing this problem but eventually I relized that this proccess would need my partners help. He is very
    good at cathcing my mistakes and as suspected, my code had very small yet vital errors that were causing my stylization to come out odd
    or nonexistant.   </span></p2>

      <div id="results">
        <h3> Results </h3>
        <p3> <span class="maintext"> I had a great time with this lab. I took a while to complete but I loved puting color into the webpage
        using css and the spacing to make the webpage more organized. This was another learning experience for me as I continue to make mistakes
        typing in code or lack there of. Thanks to my partner as usal for helping me get through these labs.  </span></p3>
