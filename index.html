		<H1> Nick Pippen
		<p>Hello my name is Nick Pippen. I am 20 year olds who is working on a career in graphic design.
      I am very interested in fashion design and logo design to be more specific. I  used to play baseball
			and hockey but now days I love relaxing and watching sports. I also love to travel the world and get
			adventerous when it comes to eating. I am very excited to improve my graphic design skills and hopefully
			sometime in the feature, become a sucessful graphic designer in Los Angeles.
			Thanks!
		</p>
