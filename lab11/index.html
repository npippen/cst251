    <h1> Challenges </h1>
    <p1> <span class="maintext"> This lab challenges us to work with the addition of nav and aside tabs. These new elements helped us
    create a link back to our homepage and give us a seperate text box for the random facts about myself. There were pretty easy to
    implement and turned out being a interesting aspect to the homepage. </span></p1>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2> Problems </h2>
    <p2> <span class="maintext"> This lab was far from smooth. I had my first problem arrise when I tried to add my nav and aside to my css. It was kind
    of hard to even know what to put in but eventually I figured that part out. When  I thought i had it all figured it out I committed
    to master and I frustarated to see that my page looked horrible. My origional content was moved to the far right side and overlapped
    with my link to home page. After this I figured that the only way to find out why this was happening was to inspect my page on the browser.
    It turned out that doing this would'nt reveal what was wrong. I then went back to my atom code and mess around with it. I ended up moving
    my aside down below my headers and that did it. I cleaned up my chaning some padding and colors and it looked ready to go. </span></p2>

      <div id="results">
        <h3> Results </h3>
        <p3> <span class="maintext"> This lab was proabbly the hardest yet and it looked a while to figure out some complicated stuff. For once
        I actually completed the main section and problem encountered nostly by myself which was a growing point for me becuase usually I take
        partner's lead. In the end I actually liked the lab aside from the problems I had becasue of the new content we learned.  </span></p3>
