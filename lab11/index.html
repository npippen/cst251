    <h1> Challenges </h1>
    <p1> <span class="maintext"> The challenge of this lab was nothing significant ata all. If anything it was getting different colors to stylize
    our webpage and most of all it was the font family change we did. Normallaly we would just use the same font as we always do but this time we
    ventured out and found a new font to stylize text elements in our body and headers.  </span></p1>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2> Problems </h2>
    <p2> <span class="maintext"> The only problem I had with this lab was getting my new font I picked to commit to the wepapge as I saved and committed to master.
    I chose "Arial Black" as my new font and when I saved it, it would'nt change. To fix this problem my partner suggested we break up the header
    paragrpah code into seperate alligators. When I made this changed and committed to master, my webpages fonts had been changed and I was done with the lab. </span></p2>

      <div id="results">
        <h3> Results </h3>
        <p3> <span class="maintext"> This lab was proabbly the easiest yet and good thing to as I was very crunched for time. I did however enjoy the simpleness
        because I liked looking at differen font options to stylize my text elements with. I also did more exploring for new colors and tested
        different spacing sizing. </span></p3>
