      <h1>  Challenge:</h1>
      <p1> <span class="maintext"> This labs's challenge was to create a replica of a webpage using css and html. We knew that we would be very challenged in Lab 14 so we tried
			our best to replicate a easy looking webpage. This lab focussed learning new ways to layout text and images and messing around in chrome inspect to see what we would need
		  to do to make our html look the same as the webpage would.</span></p1>

      <h2> Problems: </h2>
      <p2> <span class="maintext">  This lab was pretty difficult for us and all of our challenges were faced while recreating the the webpage as espected.
		  We struggled with getting text to be in the same spots as the webpage we looked at. We also had confussion on how to specifically get some of our text in different spots on the page such as middle and bootom corners.
			However, I would say getting similar text and look-alike images was decentlly east for the both of us. </span><p2>

        <div id="results">
          <h3> Results:</h3>
          <p3> <span class="maintext"> I think we could have done better but none the less we put together a solid replica webpage that is overall very similar. I think this is a good
						starting point to lead us into lab 14 becuase we will now know how to navigate essentially the same lab.
