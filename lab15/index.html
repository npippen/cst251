    <h1> Challenges </h1>
    <p2> <span class="maintext"> Part 2 to this Advanced Block-level Styling lab was a challenge for my partner and I. The reason for this was
    becuase it was adding more tough elements on top of the difficult lab we had to work on last time in part 1. This lab challenged us to
    to make 4 extra divs than usual. Two text elements and two image elements were added to the to our webpage. Once we added these new
    divs, we then had to do the difficult tasks presented in the css.  </span></p2>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2> Problems </h2>
    <p3> <span class="maintext"> The problems that came form this lab came in the css styling part of the lab. We were asked to make the
    iamges smaller than usual, and that was easy to complete. Where we started having trouble, was making the floating and centering
    of the new text and image elements. We were able to do our best putting in the code but my partner and I were both unsure whether we did
    it right and if it was showing up how it was supposed to be. </span></p3>

      <div id="results">
        <h3> Results </h3>
        <p4> <span class="maintext"> In the end we wer eleft with a lot of questions yet we still were able to complete half of the lab at least.
        This webpage it self actually turned out looking very clean and attractive. Might be my favorite so far. The portortions look good
        and the new text elements look good and centered. Not sure if I did the endning tasks correctly as I said but I think it looks good
        regardless.   </span></p4>
