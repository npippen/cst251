    <h1> Challenges </h1>
    <p2> <span class="maintext"> This lab challenged us to input a lot of stylizing codes that would make our webpage overall more "fancy" than usual.
    It was overall very easy and took a short amount of time. With this being said it, that doesn't mean we didn't do much. We added 7 elements including text-shadow box-shadow.
    gradient, filters, rounded corners, object-fit, and transform. All of which make a visual changes to make the webpage more detailed that what we've ever explored before. </span></p2>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2> Problems </h2>
    <p3> <span class="maintext"> We honetsly didn't much of any problems to occur during this lab. We had some mistakes in our code that we had to go back and change aside
    as we have to do in any lab but other than small misques, no big problems were ecnountored.  </span></p3>

      <div id="results">
        <h3> Results </h3>
        <p4> <span class="maintext"> This was one of hte smoothest and fun labs we've ever worked on. We learned 7 fancy codes that made our webpages look so cool and fun.
        These codes were pretty easy to implement so that was nice and in the end I can see myself using these elemetns for many labs to come. </span></p4>
