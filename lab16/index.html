    <h1> Challenges </h1>
    <p2> <span class="maintext"> This Lab one definetly one of the more creative ones. It was fun while at the smae time a little tricky. Getting a background image was so tough for
    me until I got my partner's help. This and the transitions, animation, and columns were the maain "fancy elemtnets" we were instructed to add. I was able to find a cool animation
    on my own and it actualyl worked well. I also decided to go with this Halloween theme even though I could'nt get he exact background I wanted. </span></p2>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2> Problems </h2>
    <p3> <span class="maintext"> The main issue we had with this lab was the execution of the the transition and column elements. We tried s many different ways but just could not
     get anything to work becuase we had no clue where to put the code. We looked up other options on the web but nothing would come through for us. </span></p3>

      <div id="results">
        <h3> Results </h3>
        <p4> <span class="maintext"> In the end we got 2 of the for new elements to work. Unfortunately after a lot of hard for we could not seem to figure out the transistions
        and the columns. The columns showed up but looked horrible while any sort of transiton would would be no existant. Although we couldn't come through with these issues
        we still got to create one of the best webpages yet. The flexibilty of the lab allowed for great creativity opportunites and I am very proud of how mine turned out
        regardless of it missing some stuff. Forsure looking forward to learning what I did wrong and using this cool elements in the future as always. </span></p4>
