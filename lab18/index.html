<h1> Challenges </h1>

<p2> The challenge of this lab was basically to create a normal lab but create it with flex code so when shrunk the page, the element such
as the images and headers would shirnk with it and adapt to the size of the window. This is used for a phone type of screen where the
window might look different than the computer screen size. </p2>

<h2> Problems </h2>

<p3> I had alot of trouble with this lab because I was always confused of where the flex code was supposed to go and how it should look
once committed and tested. I also had problems putting in more than one image so I had to keep it at 1 image to keep it looking ok. Some
of the other problems that were encountered was the meta tag and linking it to other code other than the one it was directing to. </p3>

<h3> Results </h3>

<p4> My end result wasn't great. My page tooked fine and I had everything I needed minus some extra images. However, the flex part of the labe
was exectued very well. The title, headers, paragraphs and image shifted over and shrunk as the window was getting smaller but the nav, aside
and footer were movded down. Altough I could still see this art, the expanding text from my paregraphs would then be covered bu the image
that was shifting over. Update: I have fixed this problem at it looks good now! In the end my webpage looked pretty good. Not so attractive
 as some of my others but the repsonsiveness worked out working great. </p4>
