  <h1> Challenges</h1>
  <p1> <span class="maintext"> The challenge of this lab was to use bootstrap to create links to our past three labs as well as our
  homepage. They were very similar to the basic navbars that we have used in the past but the code was much longer and a lot more
  complicated. We were helped put severly by the websites that provided the code for us to copy and paste into our html.    </p1>

<div id="problems">
  <h2> Problems</h2>
  <p2> <span class="maintext"> We didn't have too many issues with this lab becasue a lot of it was copy and pasting. It was sort
  of hard to know where to paste our code but we tried different ways and eventually it worked. W also had some trouble with the nav
  bar code but with the help of some other classmates we were able to put it together.  </p2>
  </div>

    <div id="results">
      <h3> Results </h3>
      <p3> <span class="maintext"> This lab ended up being pretty smooth and I liked it for our last lab. Honestly, I didnt really understand
      the whole purose of the link and code we were assigned to put it but it worked well and did its job so I can see how it would come
      in handy. We didn't focuss too much on the overall look to the actual homepage but it looked decent and had a purpose. </p3>
