    <h1> Challenges </h1>
    <p2> <span class="maintext"> This lab was cool because it was individual and simple. We were asked to sketch our layouts for our website pages and to me, sketching is fun
    and easy. Then finally setting up and html and css all by myself went pretty well too. </span></p2>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2> Problems </h2>
    <p3> <span class="maintext"> I didn't have any problems with this lab other than some arrangement issues of the images of my sketches. As far as the actual sketches go,
    I had no problem getting my ideas onto paper. I went very quick and still managed to make my sketches look clean and organized. Near then end it was kinda hard
    to think of different designs to sketch out but a little brainstorming helped that and I was able to finish them all with it half an hour. </span></p3>

      <div id="results">
        <h3> Results </h3>
        <p4> <span class="maintext"> I am overall very happy about how these sketches tured out as well as the weppage. I think these sketches I've created will be a very good
        option to base our website off of. They are clean and simple yet they give a great opportunity for a great looking layout with images and information.  </span></p4>
