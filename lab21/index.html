    <h1> Challenges </h1>
    <p2> <span class="maintext"> The challenge of this lab was to make 3 detailed sketches of how we might want out webpages to look. I did 5, one for each of the
    subtopics we have come up with. I included the main elements we decided to include in all of our webpage designs. A title, at least one image, a summary, a secion of
    information, a link to our home our homepage. Speficically how it will be layed out will be changed depending on the page but we plan to keep the same key elements,
    fonts, and styles. </span></p2>

    <h2> Problems </h2>
    <p3> <span class="maintext"> I honestly didn't have any problems with this lab. I am good at sketching and coming up with good ideas involving layout options source
    creating these sketches was easy for me. I kind of just made more detailed and larger versions of my origional sketches so I didn't really have to make any new designs.  </span></p3>

      <div id="results">
        <h3> Results </h3>
        <p4> <span class="maintext"> I am very pleased with the results of my sketches. I could actually see these looking clean and realistic as a perfessional-looking webpage.
        They have an organized look to it and are simple. However they still give enough room to display all the information we need.   </span></p4>
