	<h1> Lab 4 FIle Transfer </h1>
	  <p2> For me his lab was all about review and fine tuning what we've learned in the past
		for practice sake. It was good for me to get a refresher on the basics.</p1>

	  <h2> Difficulties Encourtered </h2>
		<p2> As far as the actual lab goes, this lab was very easy. I just used my
		knowledge from last lab to open up the file and type what was needed. However
    I actually had trouble opening my Atom app but was able to problem solve and
	  figure it out.  </p3>

		<h3> Results </h3>
		<p3> My partner and I were able to check each other's work and repo's and concluded
		that everyting from last lab was still wokring fine. We also tested our files on the web and resulted that everything 
		was able to run easily.   	<p3>
