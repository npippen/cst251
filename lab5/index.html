	<h1> Lab 5 File Transfer </h1>
	  <p2> In this lab we learned for the first time how to add links into our webpage. We also did some more
		images but more sepcically images with link attatched to them. This is something that will be very
	  useful in the feautre. </p1>

	  <h2> Difficulties Encourtered </h2>
		<p2> Adding the images and the link were easy since we had already done it before but attctching a link to an image
		was sort of hard. At first it didn't work for me but after some problem solving it was working just fine.
	  I also had some minor difficulties sizing my images. The more I changed the size of the images, the more it would mess
	  up how the links and the format.</p3>

		<h3> Results </h3>
		<p3> In the end I solved all my problems. My link were able to look somewhat good along with the layout of the images.
			   This lab involved a lot of different conponents but it all came together pretty nicely. I like how I can go to all sorts
				 of different places with in this webpage. This will open a window for feature creativity forsure.  <p3>
