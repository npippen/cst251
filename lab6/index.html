  <h1> Lab 6: More Complicated HTML </h1>

	<h2> Main Idea </h2>
	  <p2>As usual, my partner and I hooped on a zoom call to complete this lab. The begining was very similar to what we've
		been doing as in the image and text context set up. The new thing that awee leanred and needed to apply was creating
	  the form as we saw our professor do in class. I was pretty fun and looked great in the end. Finally, we used a css to
	  stylise our webpage. This was one of my favorite labs because it was pretty creative with the incorporation of the form,
	  wepage colors and fonts and of course the usual image. </p2>

	  <h3> Difficulties Encourtered </h3>
		<p3> The first difuculty we ran into was the implication of the form. WE just had ahard time setting it up and replicating
		the code that was given to us. We were evetnaully able to figure it out and customized the questions to our liking.
	  personally after this step I had another problem. As I often do, I was missing so closing tabs resulting in my search button
	  not taking me to anyone. Another difficulty we faced was the css page colorizor not working. I think we just had a hard time
	  marching the code for the css in the Lab 6 folder to the index.css file. Seems simple but it took a while to notice with all
	  the content on this Lab's coding page.</p3>

		<h4> Results </h5>
		<p4> In the end we had a very nice looking webpage. This lab really showed us how creative we can get with coding with it
		being simple at the same time. We learned from or mistkaes as well. For me, I know I have to rememebr to slow down and make
	  I am getting all the important slashed and carrots because we all know its a necessity. My favorite part was searching
	  my name in the form we created and seeing my name pop up on the internet with all my references to my name.</p4>
