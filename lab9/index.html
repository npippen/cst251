    <h1> Challenges </h1> 
    <p1> <span class="maintext"> This lab was basically the same as lab 7. We foccused on more of the customization of a webpage. We added color,
    borders and spacing to the webpage along with the usual image. It was'nt much of a challenge because we had already done the same
	  procedures before. The only hard part was going slowly unlike last time to be able to get it correct the first time as I am prone
	  to missing code labels as well as certain aspects needed to complete the lab. </span></p1>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2> Problems </h2>
    <p2> <span class="maintext"> In this lab I had a big problem in getting rid of some random padding/spacing that was appearing in my html.
	  Threre was a big space between the end of my results parragraph and my grey border. Not to mention my image was cutting through both of these.
	  It was a big deal it was just sort of annoying to look at and didn't make the webpage look clean. Another problem I had is that I was not able
    to open this html in a public browser and I could not figure out why. In my reflection I've a screenshot of what it looked like when I clicked
    on my lab 8 on my homepage. I tired everything but could'nt figure it out why the link would'nt work.    </span></p2>

      <div id="results">
        <h3> Results </h2>
        <p3> <span class="maintext"> We resulted to an interesting tactic in order to fix this problem becuase when we inspected this page locally,
				we found some random quotation marks that were creating this spacing. The thing was, we could'nt find anything indicated to this problem
			  within my atom so we couldn't fix the problem. So what we did was delete the space from the inspection within the local html and then saved
			  the new fixed html to my desktop. Then we dragged it into my atom and re-named it as if it was a origioanl html. Not too sure if I'ma
			  explaining this right but in the end my webpage looks how I like it. Did'nt learn much other than a new was to make a html.  </span></p3>
