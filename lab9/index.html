    <h1> Challenges </h1>
    <p1> <span class="maintext"> This lab was mainly foccusing on the blocking of the webpage elements and as always came along with challenges.
    I found that doing bsically the same thing last lab was very helpful becuase I could jsut following along with the memory of the steps I took
    last lab. However, I still was facing the challenges of getting my blocks different from last lab. I changed color and spacing but it took
    time to figure out which tag went to which element. </span></p1>

  <div id="problems">
    <h2> Problems </h2>
    <p2> <span class="maintext"> One of the main problrems I faced was the sizing of my image. I was trying to ato size it to shrink and grow
    depending on the sie of the page. I could'nt manage to figure it out so I ended up just giving is normal dimensions as I usually do to shrink
    it down. Another problem I had was the padding and spacing inbetween the images, contents, and border. This problem was basically fixing by
    trial and error. I don't have the terms memorized meaning I don't know what they look like visually so I had to inspect the webpage to be able to
    visually see it.</span></p2>

      <div id="results">
        <h3> Results </h2>
        <p3> <span class="maintext"> This lab resulted in a new webpage that had the same layout of the webpage in Lab 8 but I just changed
        the color and image. I also resulted in messing around more with the spacing and marginizing in between images and type just so I could
        learn more and practice it. I think I also made it look very clean although not sure if my color choice was the best. I did however learn
        learn how to change the color of text which will be very usefull in the future. </span></p3>
